running these snippets can be problematic because the data is being brought in as a separate file.

to get around this problem, you can create a simple server.

from the d3-snippets folder, start the server by running the following in the console:

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

then go to ```localhost:8000``` and enjoy!
